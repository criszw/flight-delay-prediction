# flight-delay-prediction
Integrate ARIMA modeling and supervised classification algorithms to analyze and predicts flight departure delays in the United States. 

Flight delays are a major inconvenience for airlines, airports and passengers. 
Almost 8 billion dollars is spent every year by aircraft companies due to delays 
therefore an accurate prediction is beneficial for all parties involved in the 
aviation industry, especially people like me that like to travel. This repository
explores the methodology of ARIMA time-series and several supervised classification
models to analyze and predict flight delays at take-off. The purpose of 
the project is to emphasize on the various steps to build a predictive model. I
comment on some of the R packages used. I use ggplot2 and Tableau to highlight results 
from exploratory data analysis. I explain the benefits of cross vallidation. This project
contains several classification algorithms that could be used and explanations  in regard to the 
restrictions in terms of the state of the data and the trade-offs of each model. 
I also include a summary of the theory of ARIMA time series and its implementation in this particular problem.
